        <!-- Q1 TOP THREE CHALLENGES DURING IMPLEMENTATION-->
        <div>
            <h3>TOP THREE CHALLENGES DURING IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
            <h4>1. Challenge 1</h4>
            <p>I had previously never learnt or done HTML or CSS before. So, I did not know what to expect, and what it contained besides some basic knowledge like “tags” and “stylesheets” for example were involved. </p>
            <h4>2. Challenge 2</h4>
            <p>Trying to understand flexboxes and grids was quite a challenge, as I hadn’t been exposed to many of them over the time I spent learning HTML and CSS for this project. So, when they came up in the project, I had to do a lot of research to even be able to begin grasping the concepts involved.</p>
            <h4>3. Challenge 3</h4>
            <p>Keeping my code organised grew harder with every progressive line, as I was using an increased number of classes, divs and tags in general which decreased readability and my own ability to keep track of what every line was doing.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Q2 HOW I MANAGED THOSE CHALLENGES -->
        <div>
            <h3>HOW I MANAGED THE CHALLENGES</h3>
            <h4>1. Challenge 1</h4>
            <p>I <a href="https://youtu.be/a_iQb1lnAEQ" target="_blank"> watched a beginner’s course</a> on youtube from "freeCodeCamp.org" on HTML and CSS. It taught me a lot of the basics of HTML, so I was prepared for the HTML part of the project and went into the basics of CSS too. However, it didn’t go into much detail on things like flexboxes, which is where I struggled the most and spent the most time on researching while programming to try and work through my problems.</p>
            <h4>2. Challenge 2</h4>
            <p>For the grids, I watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/9zBsdzdE4sM" target="_blank">youtube video</a> from “Web Dev Simplified” on them, and I was able to do that part of the project as it gave me a good base understanding of them. As for Flexboxes, I watched another <a href="https://youtu.be/fYq5PXgSsbE" target="_blank">youtube video</a> from “Web Dev Simplified”, to give me an understanding of some more specific issues I was facing with the CSS.</p>
            <h4>3. Challenge 3</h4>
            <p>I took notes of things to change and check on later using OneNote, and used comments throughout the CSS and in the HTML files to help make sure I’d always be able to quickly know what things were for. Especially because if i added a comment above a section of code for a specific function it meant that when I collapsed the code, I knew what the contents did at a glance as the comment would not collapse with it. I also used class names that were specific and explained the function of that class. This helped maintain clarity.</p>

        <!-- Q3  TOP THREEE THINGS LEARNT DURING IMPLEMENTATION -->
        <div class="bottom_page">
            <h3>TOP THREE THINGS LEARNED DURING IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
            <p>1. I think a useful piece of knowledge I gained from this project overall, was how much I enjoyed web development, as previously I had not delved into it and didn’t intend to for at least a little while. I found the “simple to learn, difficult to master” nature of HTML and CSS quite interesting. I found that at its core, HTML was simple, mostly seeming straightforward, but the CSS was the more difficult, thought provoking and rewarding part. Especially having to learn new things within it on the fly like how to use background images and as mentioned above, flexboxes and grids. I think web development will be a topic I look into more in the future because of how much I’ve enjoyed it.</p>
            <p>2. A skill I learnt from the project would be some more general skills I picked up on throughout my time programming. I was far better able by the end to quickly find answers to any questions I might have for errors or unexpected things occurring than I was at the start. Part of this may have been because I was more familiar with the terms used in HTML/CSS so could better target searches, but also, I got better at knowing immediately what is relevant to me and what isn’t. Another general skill would be the importance of commenting the code. Previously I just commented the major sections (Like Left column, right column) but the problem was I’d not work on it for a few days and would come back and not know where anything was. Commenting everything out in more detail (e.g., Left column, then underneath “Contacts Tab”, “Education Tab”, “Skills Tab”) meant I could come understand the code a lot better. It also meant when I collapsed a section of code in VSCode, the comment would remain, and I’d know what exactly that collapsed section contained which helped massively in cleaning it up while programming.</p>
            <p>3. I think a more specific (for web development) thing I learnt during my time trying to develop this website and make it functional, was how useful the browsers inspect element was for identifying errors. On Microsoft Edge for example (I do not use other browsers, so this may not be the case for all), it would tell you about what may be preventing your CSS from working and gave you a straightforward way to see if any changes in your CSS could fix issues. For example, you can change the amount of padding added in the browser and it will update live, which is a lot quicker to do than changing it in Visual Studio then saving and then refreshing.</p>
